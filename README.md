# Python Functions: Word Frequency and Shape Area

This repository contains Python code implementing two functionalities:

1. Word Frequency Calculation: A function to compute the frequency of words from an input string and sort them alphabetically.

2. Shape Area Calculation: Classes representing basic geometric shapes, including a `Shape` class with a default area of 0 and a `Square` subclass.

3. Write a main function on a different file that calls all functions

4. Run each algorithm in parallel with multi-thread processing.

5. Write unit-tests for each function in the code.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pytest (for running unit tests)

## Usage

### Word Frequency Calculation

To compute the frequency of words from an input string, use the `word_frequency` function from the `word_frequency.py` module.
